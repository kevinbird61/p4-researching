# Route Configuration

This repository is a lab for the course "Introduction to Computer Networks 2018" in NCTU CS.
* Please refer to [lab3_tasks.pdf](https://github.com/kevinbird61/p4-researching/blob/master/course/nctucn2018/lab3_init/lab3_tasks.pdf) to finish this lab.

## Abstract

In this lab, we are going to write a Python program with Ryu SDN framework to build a simple software-defined network and compare the different between two forwarding rules.

---
## Objectives

1. Learn how to build a simple software-defined networking with Ryu SDN framework
2. Learn how to add forwarding rule into each OpenFlow switch

---
## Execution

> TODO:
> * How to run your program?
> * What is the meaning of the executing command (both Mininet and Ryu controller)?
> * Show the screenshot of using iPerf command in Mininet (both `SimpleController.py` and `controller.py`)

---
## Description

### Tasks

> TODO:
> * Describe how you finish this work in detail

1. Environment Setup

2. Example of Ryu SDN

3. Mininet Topology

4. Ryu Controller

5. Measurement

### Discussion

> TODO:
> * Answer the following questions

1. Describe the difference between packet-in and packet-out in detail.
   
2. What is “table-miss” in SDN?
   
3. Why is "`(app_manager.RyuApp)`" adding after the declaration of class in `controller.py`?
   
4. Explain the following code in `controller.py`.
    ```python
    @set_ev_cls(ofp_event.EventOFPPacketIn, CONFIG_DISPATCHER)
    ```

5. What is the meaning of “datapath” in `controller.py`?
   
6. Why need to set "`ip_proto=17`" in the flow entry?
   
7. Compare the differences between the iPerf results of `SimpleController.py` and `controller.py` in detail.
   
8. Which forwarding rule is better? Why?
